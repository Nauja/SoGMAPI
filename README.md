Modding API for Secret of Grindea

## How it works

The official game executable **Secrets Of Grindea.exe** is modified to include the ModLoader. The ModLoader is a bridge between the game source code and the modding API. It takes care of loading and initialiazing mods installed in the **Mods** subfolder when the game starts.

Game sources will never be uploaded here, only the modified "Secret Of Grindea.exe" containing the ModLoader.
