* For players:
  * You can now download SMAPI 'strict mode' from [Nexus files](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400/?tab=files), which removes all deprecated APIs. This may significantly improve performance, but mods which still show deprecation warnings won't work.
  * The SMAPI installer now also detects game folders in Steam's `.vdf` library data on Windows (thanks to pizzaoverhead!).

  * Other internal optimizations.
  * Added more file extensions to ignore when searching for mod folders: `.7z`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, and `.xcf` (thanks to atravita!).

## 3.16.0
Released 22 August 2022 for Stardew Valley 1.5.6 or later. See [release highlights](https://www.patreon.com/posts/70797008).

* For players:
  * Added error message if mod files are detected directly under `Mods` (instead of each mod having its own subfolder).
  * SMAPI now sets a success/error code when the game exits.  
    _This is used by your OS (like Windows) to decide whether to keep the console window open when the game ends._
  * Fixed SMAPI on Windows applying different DPI awareness settings than the game (thanks to spacechase0!).
  * Fixed Linux/macOS installer's color scheme question partly unreadable if the terminal background is dark.
  * Fixed error message when a mod loads an invalid PNG file (thanks to atravita!).
  * Fixed error message when a mod is duplicated, but one of the copies is also missing the DLL file. This now shows the duplicate-mod message instead of the missing-DLL message.
  * Fixed macOS launcher using Terminal regardless of the system's default terminal (thanks to ishan!).
  * Fixed best practices in Linux/macOS launcher scripts (thanks to ishan!).
  * Improved translations. Thanks to KediDili (updated Turkish)!

* For mod authors:
  * While loading your mod, SMAPI now searches for indirect dependencies in your mod's folder (thanks to TehPers)! This mainly enables F# mods.
  * **Raised deprecation message levels.**  
    _Deprecation warnings are now player-visible in the SMAPI console as faded `DEBUG` messages._
  * Updated to Pintail 2.2.1 (see [changes](https://github.com/Nanoray-pl/Pintail/blob/master/docs/release-notes.md#221)).

  * Fixed lag for some players since Stardew Valley 1.5.5.
  * Fixed `smapi-internal/config.user.json` overrides not applied after SMAPI 3.14.0.
  * Fixed PyTK not rescaling images correctly in some cases.  
    _When PyTK 1.23.0 or earlier is installed, this will disable the main performance improvements in SMAPI 3.15.0._
  * Updated compatibility list.

* For mod authors:
  * The [FluentHttpClient package](https://github.com/Pathoschild/FluentHttpClient#readme) is now loaded by SMAPI.

  * Updated compatibility list.

* For mod authors:
  * Added an [`IRawTextureData` asset type](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_SMAPI_4.0#Raw_texture_data), to avoid creating full `Texture2D` instances in many cases.
  * In `smapi-internal/config.json`, you can now enable verbose logging for specific mods (instead of all or nothing).
  * Updated dependencies:
    * Harmony 2.2.1 (see changes in [2.2.0](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/releases/tag/v2.2.0.0) and [2.2.1](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/releases/tag/v2.2.1.0));

  * Removed transitional `UsePintail` option added in 3.14.0 (now always enabled).
  * Fixed `onBehalfOf` arguments in the new content API being case-sensitive.
  * Fixed map edits which change warps sometimes rebuilding the NPC pathfinding cache unnecessarily, which could cause a noticeable delay for players.

## 3.14.7
Released 01 June 2022 for Stardew Valley 1.5.6 or later.

Released 15 May 2022 for Stardew Valley 1.5.6 or later.

* For players:

Released 12 May 2022 for Stardew Valley 1.5.6 or later.

* For players:
  * Reduced in-game performance impact.

* For mod authors:
  * Refactored how event handling works under the hood, particularly the new content API. This should have no effect on mod usage.

## 3.14.2
Released 08 May 2022 for Stardew Valley 1.5.6 or later.

* For players:
  * Enabled case-insensitive file paths by default for Android and Linux players.  
    _This was temporarily disabled in SMAPI 3.14.1, and will remain disabled by default on macOS and Windows since their filesystems are already case-insensitive._
  * Various performance improvements.
* For mod authors:
  * Dynamic content packs created via `helper.ContentPacks.CreateTemporary` or `CreateFake` are now listed in the log file.
  * Fixed assets loaded through a fake content pack not working correctly since 3.14.0.

Released 06 May 2022 for Stardew Valley 1.5.6 or later.

* For players:
  * Improved performance for mods still using the previous content API.
  * Disabled case-insensitive file paths (introduced in 3.14.0) by default.  
    _You can enable them by editing `smapi-internal/config.json` if needed. They'll be re-enabled in an upcoming version after they're reworked a bit._
  * Removed experimental 'aggressive memory optimizations' option.  
    _This was disabled by default and is no longer needed in most cases. Memory usage will be better reduced by reworked asset propagation in the upcoming SMAPI 4.0.0._
  * Fixed 'content file was not found' error when the game tries to load unlocalized text from a localizable mod data asset in 3.14.0.
  * Fixed error reading empty JSON files. These are now treated as if they didn't exist (matching pre-3.14.0 behavior).
  * Updated compatibility list.

## 3.14.0
Released 01 May 2022 for Stardew Valley 1.5.6 or later. See [release highlights](https://www.patreon.com/posts/65265507).

### For players
This is a big update, but existing mods should all work fine. If the latest version of a mod breaks in SMAPI 3.14, please report it [on the SMAPI mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400?tab=posts).

* Improvements:
  * SMAPI now ignores dot-prefixed files when searching for mod folders (thanks to Nuztalgia!).
  * On Linux, SMAPI now fixes many case-sensitive mod path issues automatically.
  * On Linux/macOS, added `--use-current-shell` [command-line argument](technical/smapi.md#command-line-arguments) to avoid opening a separate terminal window.
  * Improved performance in some cases.
  * Improved translations. Thanks to ChulkyBow (updated Ukrainian)!
  * Dropped update checks for the unofficial 64-bit patcher (obsolete since SMAPI 3.12.6).
* Fixes:
  * Fixed some movie theater textures not translated when loaded through SMAPI (specifically assets with the `_international` suffix).
  * Fixed the warning text when a mod causes an asset load conflict with itself.
  * Fixed `--no-terminal` [command-line argument](technical/smapi.md#command-line-arguments) on Linux/macOS still opening a terminal window, even if nothing is logged to it (thanks to Ryhon0!).
  * Fixed `player_add` console command not handling journal scraps and secret notes correctly.
  * Fixed `set_farm_type` console command not updating warps.
* For the web UI:
  * Improved log parser UI (thanks to KhloeLeclair!):
    * Added pagination for big logs.
    * Added search box to filter the log.
    * Added option to show/hide content packs in the mod list.
    * Added jump links in the sidebar.
    * The filter options now stick to the top of the screen when scrolling.
    * Rewrote rendering to improve performance.

### For mod authors
This is a big release that includes the new features planned for SMAPI 4.0.0.

For C# mod authors: your mods should still work fine in SMAPI 3.14.0. However you should review the [migration to SMAPI 4.0](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_SMAPI_4.0) guide and update your mods when possible. Deprecated code will be removed when SMAPI 4.0.0 releases later this year (no sooner than August 2022), and break any mods which haven't updated by that time. You can update affected mods now, there's no need to wait for 4.0.0.

For content pack authors: SMAPI 3.14.0 and 4.0.0 don't affect content packs. They should work fine as long as
the C# mod that loads them is updated.

* Major changes:
  * Added [content events](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Events#Content), which will replace `IAssetEditor` and `IAssetLoader` in SMAPI 4.0.0.  
    _These include new features not supported by the old API like load conflict resolution, edit priority, and content pack labels. They also support new cases like easily detecting when an asset has changed, and avoid data corruption issues in some edge cases._
  * Added [nullable reference type annotations](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_SMAPI_4.0#Nullable_reference_type_annotations) for all APIs.
  * Added [`helper.GameContent` and `helper.ModContent`](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_SMAPI_4.0#Content_loading_API), which will replace `helper.Content` in SMAPI 4.0.0.
  * Improved [mod-provided API](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Integrations#Mod-provided_APIs) proxying (thanks to Shockah!).  
    _This adds support for custom interfaces in return values or input arguments, custom enums if their values match, generic methods, and more. This is an internal change, you don't need to do anything different in your mod code._
  * Mod files loaded through SMAPI APIs (including `helper.Content.Load`) are now case-insensitive, even on Linux.
  * Enabled deprecation notices for all deprecated APIs. These will only be shown in `TRACE` logs for at least a month after SMAPI 3.14.0 releases.
* Other improvements:
  * Added `IAssetDataForImage.ExtendMap` to resize maps in asset editors.
  * Added `IContentPack.ModContent` property to manage content pack assets.
  * Added `Constants.ContentPath` to get the full path to the game's `Content` folder.
  * Added `IAssetName` fields to the info received by `IAssetEditor`, `IAssetLoader`, and content event methods.  
    _This adds methods for working with asset names, parsed locales, etc._
  * Added `helper.Content.ParseAssetName` to get an `IAssetName` for an arbitrary asset key.
  * Added [command-line arguments](technical/smapi.md#command-line-arguments) to toggle developer mode (thanks to Tondorian!).
  * If an asset is loaded multiple times in the same tick, `IAssetLoader.CanLoad` and `IAssetEditor.CanEdit` are now cached unless invalidated by `helper.Content.InvalidateCache`.
  * The `ISemanticVersion` comparison methods (`CompareTo`, `IsBetween`, `IsNewerThan`, and `IsOlderThan`) now allow null values. A null version is always considered older than any non-null version per [best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icomparable-1.compareto#remarks).
  * Deprecation notices now show a shorter stack trace in most cases, so it's clearer where the deprecated code is in the mod.
* Fixes:
  * Fixed the `SDate` constructor being case-sensitive.
  * Fixed support for using locale codes from custom languages in asset names (e.g. `Data/Achievements.eo-EU`).
  * Fixed issue where suppressing `[Left|Right]Thumbstick[Down|Left]` keys would suppress the opposite direction instead.
  * Fixed null handling in various edge cases.
* For the web UI:
  * Updated the JSON validator/schema for Content Patcher 1.25.0.
  * Added `data-*` attributes to the log parser page for external tools.
  * Fixed JSON validator showing incorrect error for update keys without a subkey.

### For SMAPI contributors

  * Updated the JSON validator/schema for Content Patcher 1.24.0.

**Update note for players with older systems:**  
The game now has two branches: the _main branch_ which you'll get by default, and an optional
[_compatibility branch_ for older systems](https://www.stardewvalley.net/compatibility/). The two
branches have identical content, but use [different technologies](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_Stardew_Valley_1.5.5#Game_compatibility_branch).

Unfortunately **SMAPI only supports the main branch of the game**. There are formidable difficulties
across all mods in supporting all three variations, 32-bit imposes significant restrictions on what
mods can do, and the [Steam hardware stats](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey) show that 99.69%
of players now have 64-bit.

## 3.12.8
Released 18 October 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.

* For players:
  * Fixed mod edits to the farmhouse shifting the player down one tile in some cases.
  * Fixed map tile rotations/flips not working for farmhands in split-screen mode.
  * Improved translations. Thanks to ellipszist (added Thai) and Zangorr (added Polish)!  
    _These are custom languages which require Stardew Valley 1.5.5 and the [Polish](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3616) or [Thai](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7052) mod._

* For mod authors:
  * SMAPI now intercepts dictionary duplicate-key errors and adds the key to the error message to simplify troubleshooting. (Due to Harmony limitations, this only works for the dictionary types used by the game.)
  * Fixed barn/coop exit warps being reset when you edit their interior map.

* For the web UI:
  * Added support for unified [mod data overrides](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Mod_compatibility#Mod_data_overrides) defined on the wiki.
  * The mod compatibility list now shows separate beta stats when 'show advanced info' is enabled.

## 3.12.7
Released 18 September 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.

* For players:
  * Added more progress updates in the log during startup.
  * Simplified asset load error message.
  * Simplified exception logs.
  * Fixed crash loading mods with corrupted translation files.

* For mod authors:
  * Added asset propagation for `LooseSprites\Giftbox`.
  * Improved SMAPI's crossplatform read/writing of `Color`, `Point`, `Rectangle`, and `Vector2` in JSON to support nullable fields too.

* For the web UI:
  * The mod compatibility list now shows the beta status by default (if any).
  * Fixed JSON validator line numbers sometimes incorrect.

## 3.12.6
Released 03 September 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.

* For players:
  * Added friendly error when using SMAPI 3.2._x_ with Stardew Valley 1.5.5 or later.
  * Improved mod compatibility in 64-bit mode (thanks to spacechase0!).
  * Reduced load time when scanning/rewriting many mods for compatibility.
  * **Dropped support for unofficial 64-bit mode**. You can now use the [official 64-bit Stardew Valley 1.5.5 beta](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_64-bit_on_Windows) instead.
  * Updated compatibility list.

* For mod authors:
  * Added `PathUtilities.NormalizeAssetName` and `PathUtilities.PreferredAssetSeparator` to prepare for the upcoming Stardew Valley 1.5.5.
  * **SMAPI no longer propagates changes to `Data/Bundles`.**  
    _You can still load/edit the asset like usual, but if bundles have already been loaded for a save, SMAPI will no longer dynamically update the in-game bundles to reflect the changes. Unfortunately this caused bundle corruption when playing in non-English._
  * Fixed content packs created via `helper.ContentPacks.CreateFake` or `CreateTemporary` not initializing translations correctly.

* For console commands:
  * Added `hurry_all` command which immediately warps all NPCs to their scheduled positions.

**Update note for mod authors:**  
Stardew Valley 1.5.5 will change how asset names are formatted. If you use `PathUtilities.NormalizePath`
to format asset names, you should switch to `PathUtilities.NormalizeAssetName` now so your code will
continue working in the next game update.

## 3.12.5
Released 26 August 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.

* Fixed some mods in unofficial 64-bit mode no longer loading after SMAPI 3.12.3.

* For players:
  * Added friendly error in 64-bit mode when a mod is 32-bit only.
  * Fixed console encoding issues on Linux/macOS.
  * Fixed some installer errors not showing info header.

* For mod authors:
  * Added `helper.Translation.GetInAllLocales` to get a translation in every available locale.
  * Fixed Visual Studio debugger crash when any mods are rewritten for compatibility (thanks to spacechase0!).

  * Fixed error creating a new save or joining a multiplayer world in 3.12.1.

* For mod authors:
  * Reverted the `Constants.Save*` fix in SMAPI 3.12.1.  
    _The change caused a number of other issues, and is only needed for rare cases where the save folder was invalid. This may be revisited in a future version instead._
  * Fixed `NullReferenceException` in SMAPI's error-handling when trying to handle an invalid `ReflectionTypeLoadException`.

## 3.12.1
Released 03 August 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.

* For players:
  * Added save recovery when content mods leave null objects in the save (in _Error Handler_).

  * SMAPI now intercepts `KeyNotFoundException` errors and adds the key to the error message to simplify troubleshooting. (Due to Harmony limitations, this only works for the dictionary types used by the game.)
  * Fixed error loading `.xnb` files from the local mod folder.
  * Fixed reloading a map not correctly reapplying interior doors.

## 3.11.0
Released 09 July 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4. See [release highlights](https://www.patreon.com/posts/53514295).

Released 03 May 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.

* For players:
  * Fixed installer leaving an unneeded `StardewModdingAPI-x64.exe` file in 32-bit game folders.

## 3.10
Released 03 May 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4. See [release highlights](https://www.patreon.com/posts/50764911).

* For players:
  * Added full support for the [unofficial 64-bit Stardew Valley patch](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_64-bit_on_Windows), which removes memory limits. The installer detects which version of SMAPI you need, and SMAPI shows update alerts for Stardew64Installer if applicable.
  * Added smarter grouping for skipped mods, so it's easier to see root dependencies to update first.
  * Added crash recovery when the game can't update a map's seasonal tilesheets _(in Error Handler)_. SMAPI will log an error and keep the previous tilesheets in that case.
  * Added installer option to enter a custom game path even if it detected a game folder.
  * `*.ico` files are now ignored when scanning for mods.
  * Fixed error for non-English players after returning to title, reloading, and entering town with a completed movie theater.
  * Fixed `world_clear` console command not removing resource clumps outside the farm and secret woods.
  * Fixed error running SMAPI in a strict sandbox on Linux (thanks to kuesji!).
  * Fixed `StardewModdingAPI.bin.osx` on macOS overwritten with an identical file on launch which would reset file permissions (thanks to 007wayne!).
  * Fixed inconsistent spelling/style for 'macOS'.

* For modders:
  * Added support for [ignoring local map tilesheet files when loading a map](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Maps#Local_copy_of_a_vanilla_tilesheet).
  * Added asset propagation for `Data\Concessions`.
  * Added SMAPI version and bitness to the console title before startup to simplify troubleshooting.
  * If a map loads a tilesheet path with no file extension, SMAPI now automatically links it to a `.png` version in the map folder if possible.
  * Improved error-handling during asset propagation.
  * Fixed `Context.IsMainPlayer` returning true for a farmhand in split-screen mode before the screen is initialized.
  * Fixed error when editing bundle data while a split-screen player is joining.
  * Fixed update subkeys not working in file descriptions for Nexus mods marked as adult content.

## 3.9.5
Released 21 March 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.

* For players:
  * Added console command to reset community center bundles _(in Console Commands)_.
  * Disabled aggressive memory optimization by default.  
    _The option was added in SMAPI 3.9.2 to reduce errors for some players, but it can cause multiplayer crashes with some mods. If you often see `OutOfMemoryException` errors, you can edit `smapi-internal/config.json` to re-enable it. We're experimenting with making Stardew Valley 64-bit to address memory issues more systematically._
  * Fixed bundles corrupted in non-English saves created after SMAPI 3.9.2.  
    _If you have an affected save, you can load your save and then enter the `regenerate_bundles confirm` command in the SMAPI console to fix it._
  * Internal changes to prepare for unofficial 64-bit.

* For mod authors:
  * Improved asset propagation:
    * Added for interior door sprites.
    * SMAPI now updates the NPC pathfinding cache when map warps are changed through the content API.
    * Reduced performance impact of invalidating cached assets before a save is loaded.
    * Fixed asset changes not reapplied in the edge case where you're playing in non-English, and the changes are only applied after the save is loaded, and the player returns to title and reloads a save, and the game reloads the target asset before the save is loaded.
  * Added a second `KeybindList` constructor to simplify single-key default bindings.
  * Added a `Constants.GameFramework` field which indicates whether the game is using XNA Framework or MonoGame.  
    _Note: mods don't need to handle the difference in most cases, but some players may use MonoGame on Windows in upcoming versions. Mods which check `Constants.TargetPlatform` should review usages as needed._

## 3.9.4
Released 07 March 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.

* For players:
  * Fixed installer error if the `Mods` folder doesn't exist in 3.9.3.

## 3.9.3
Released 07 March 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.

* For players:
  * Added descriptive error if possible when a `PathTooLongException` crashes SMAPI or the installer.

* For mod authors:
  * Added three stages to the specialised [`LoadStageChanged` event](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Events#Specialised): `CreatedInitialLocations`, `SaveAddedLocations`, and `ReturningToTitle`.
  * Fixed `RewriteMods` option ignored when rewriting for OS compatibility.
  * Fixed edge case when playing as a farmhand in non-English where translatable assets loaded via `IAssetLoader` weren't reapplied immediately when the server disconnects.

* For the web UI:
  * Updated the JSON validator/schema for Content Patcher 1.21.

## 3.9.2

  * Improved error when `Stardew Valley.exe` exists but can't be loaded.
  * Fixed error running `install on Windows.bat` in very rare cases.
  * Fixed `world_settime` command not always updating outdoor ambient lighting _(in Console Commands)_.

* For mod authors:
  * Added early detection of disposed textures so the error details are more relevant _(in Error Handler)_.
  * Added error details when an event command fails _(in Error Handler)_.
  * Fixed asset propagation for `TileSheets/ChairTiles` not changing existing map seats.
  * Fixed edge case when playing in non-English where translatable assets loaded via `IAssetLoader` would no longer be applied after returning to the title screen unless manually invalidated from the cache.

* For the web UI:
  * Updated compatibility list for the new wiki.
  * Updated the JSON validator/schema for Content Patcher 1.20.
  * Fixed mod compatibility list error if a mod has no name.

* For SMAPI developers:
  * Fixed SMAPI toolkit defaulting the mod type incorrectly if a mod's `manifest.json` has neither `EntryDll` nor `ContentPackFor`. This only affects external tools, since SMAPI itself validates those fields separately.

## 3.9.1
Released 25 January 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.

* For players:
  * Fixed _tile contains an invalid TileSheet reference_ crash after mods change certain maps.

## 3.9
Released 22 January 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.4. See [release highlights](https://www.patreon.com/posts/46553874).

* For players:
  * Updated for Stardew Valley 1.5.4.
  * Improved game detection in the installer:
    * The installer now prefers paths registered by Steam or GOG Galaxy.
    * The installer now detects default manual GOG installs.
  * Added clearer error text for empty mod folders created by Vortex.
  * Fixed the game's map changes not always reapplied correctly after mods change certain maps, which caused issues like the community center resetting to its non-repaired texture.
  * Fixed compatibility for very old content packs which still load maps from `.xnb` files. These were broken by map loading changes in Stardew Valley 1.5, but SMAPI now corrects them automatically.
  * Fixed some broken mods incorrectly listed as XNB mods under 'skipped mods'.

* For mod authors:
  * Added new input APIs:
    * Added an [API for multi-key bindings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Input#KeybindList).
    * Added a new [`Input.ButtonsChanged` event](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Events#Input.ButtonsChanged).
    * Added a `buttonState.IsDown()` extension.
    * Added a `helper.Input.SuppressActiveKeybinds` method to suppress the active buttons in a keybind list.
  * Improved multiplayer APIs:
    * `PerScreen<T>` now lets you get/set the value for any screen, get all active values, or clear all values.
    * Peer data from the multiplayer API/events now includes `IsSplitScreen` and `ScreenID` fields.
    * Fixed network messages through the multiplayer API being sent to players who don't have SMAPI installed in some cases.
  * Improved asset propagation:
    * Updated map propagation for the changes in Stardew Valley 1.5.4.
    * Added propagation for some `Strings\StringsFromCSFiles` keys (mainly short day names).
    * Fixed quarry bridge not fixed if the mountain map was reloaded.
  * Added an option to disable rewriting mods for compatibility (thanks to Bpendragon!). This prevents older mods from loading, but bypasses a Visual Studio crash when debugging.
  * Game errors shown in the chatbox are now logged.
  * Moved vanilla error-handling into a new Error Handler mod. This simplifies the core SMAPI logic, and lets users disable it if needed.

* For the Console Commands mod:
  * Removed the `inf` option for `player_sethealth`, `player_setmoney`, and `player_setstamina`. You can use mods like [CJB Cheats Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4) instead for that.

* For the Error Handler mod:
  * Added a detailed message for the _Input string was not in a correct format_ error when the game fails to parse an item text description.

* For the web UI:
  * Fixed JSON validator incorrectly marking some manifest update keys as invalid.

## 3.8.4
Released 15 January 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.3 or later.

* For players:
  * Updated for Stardew Valley 1.5.3.
  * Fixed issue where title screen music didn't stop after loading a save.

* For mod authors:
  * Fixed `SemanticVersion` comparisons returning wrong value in rare cases.

## 3.8.3
Released 08 January 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.2 or later.

* For players:
  * Updated for Stardew Valley 1.5.2.
  * Reduced memory usage.
  * You can now enter console commands for a specific screen in split-screen mode by adding `screen=ID` to the command.
  * Typing `help` in the SMAPI console is now more helpful.

* For mod authors:
  * Simplified tilesheet order warning added in SMAPI 3.8.2.

* For the Console Commands mod:
  * Removed experimental `performance` command. Unfortunately this impacted SMAPI's memory usage and performance, and the data was often misinterpreted. This may be replaced with more automatic performance alerts in a future version.

## 3.8.2
Released 03 January 2021 for Stardew Valley 1.5.1 or later.

* For players:
  * SMAPI now blocks farm map replacements that would crash the game in Stardew Valley 1.5.
  * On Linux, the SMAPI installer now auto-detects Flatpak Steam paths.
  * Updated compatibility list.
  * Fixed errors when multiple players join in split-screen mode.
  * Fixed 'skipped mods' section repeating mods in some cases.
  * Fixed out-of-date error text.

* For mod authors:
  * Added warning when a map replacement changes the order/IDs of the original tilesheets, which may cause errors and crashes. Doing so for a farm map is blocked outright since that causes a consistent crash in Stardew Valley 1.5.
  * Message data from the `ModMessageReceived` event now uses the same serializer settings as the rest of SMAPI. That mainly adds support for sending crossplatform `Color`, `Point`, `Vector2`, `Rectangle`, and `SemanticVersion` fields through network messages.
  * When a mod is blocked by SMAPI's compatibility override list, the `TRACE` messages while loading it now say so and indicate why.
  * Fixed how the input API handles UI scaling. This mainly affects `ICursorPosition` values returned by the API; see [the wiki docs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Input#ICursorPosition) for how to account for UI scaling.

## 3.8.1
Released 26 December 2020 for Stardew Valley 1.5.1 or later.

* For players:
  * Fixed broken community center bundles for non-English saves created in Stardew Valley 1.5. Affected saves will be fixed automatically on load.

* For mod authors:
  * World events are now raised for volcano dungeon levels.
  * Added `apply_save_fix` command to reapply a save migration in exceptional cases. This should be used very carefully. Type `help apply_save_fix` for details.
  * **Deprecation notice:** the `Helper.ConsoleCommands.Trigger` method is now deprecated and should no longer be used. See [integration APIs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Integrations) for better mod integration options. It will eventually be removed in SMAPI 4.0.

For the web UI:
  * Fixed edge cases in SMAPI log parsing.

## 3.8
Released 21 December 2020 for Stardew Valley 1.5 or later. See [release highlights](https://www.patreon.com/posts/45294737).

* For players:
  * Updated for Stardew Valley 1.5, including split-screen support.
  * You can now run the installer from a subfolder of your game folder to auto-detect it. That simplifies installation if you have multiple copies of the game or it can't otherwise auto-detect the game path.
  * Clarified error when the SMAPI installer is in the `Mods` folder.

* For mod authors:
  * Added `PerScreen<T>` utility and new `Context` fields to simplify split-screen support in mods.

  * `player_add` can now spawn shirts normally only available during character customization.
  * `player_add` now applies fish pond rules for roe items. (That mainly adds Clam Roe, Sea Urchin Roe, and custom roe from mods.)

## 3.7.5
Released 16 October 2020 for Stardew Valley 1.4.1 or later.

* For mod authors:
  * Fixed changes to the town map asset not reapplying the game's community center, JojaMart, and Pam house changes.

* For players:
  * Fixed mod recipe changes not always applied in 3.7.

* For mod authors:

## 3.7.1
Released 08 September 2020 for Stardew Valley 1.4.1 or later.

* For players:
  * Fixed input-handling bugs in 3.7.

## 3.7
Released 07 September 2020 for Stardew Valley 1.4.1 or later. See [release highlights](https://www.patreon.com/posts/41341767).

* For players:
  * Added heuristic compatibility rewrites. (This improves mod compatibility with Android and future game updates.)

* For the web UI:
  * Updated the JSON validator/schema for Content Patcher 1.16 and 1.17.

* For SMAPI developers:
  * The web API now returns an update alert in two new cases: any newer unofficial update (previously only shown if the mod was incompatible), and a newer prerelease version if the installed non-prerelease version is broken (previously only shown if the installed version was prerelease).
  * Reorganised the SMAPI core to reduce coupling to game types like `Game1`, make it easier to navigate, and simplify future game updates.
  * SMAPI now automatically fixes code broken by these changes in game code, so manual rewriters are no longer needed:
    * reference to a method with new optional parameters;
    * reference to a field replaced by a property;
    * reference to a field replaced by a `const` field.
  * `FieldReplaceRewriter` now supports mapping to a different target type.

## 3.6.2
Released 02 August 2020 for Stardew Valley 1.4.1 or later.

  * Reduced processing time when a mod loads many unpacked images (thanks to Entoarox!).
  * Mod load warnings are now listed alphabetically.
  * macOS files starting with `._` are now ignored and can no longer cause skipped mods.
  * Simplified paranoid warning logs and reduced their log level.

  * Fixed asset propagation for Gil's portraits.
  * Fixed `.pdb` files ignored for error stack traces when mods are rewritten by SMAPI.
  * Fixed `ModMessageReceived` event handlers not tracked for performance monitoring.

* For SMAPI developers:

  * Added option to disable console colors.
  * Updated compatibility list.

## 3.0
Released 26 November 2019 for Stardew Valley 1.4.

### Release highlights
For players:
* **Updated for Stardew Valley 1.4.**  
  SMAPI 3.0 adds compatibility with the latest game version, and improves mod APIs for changes in
  the game code.

* **Improved performance.**  
  SMAPI should have less impact on game performance and startup time for some players.

* **Automatic save fixing and more error recovery.**  
  SMAPI now detects and prevents more crashes due to game/mod bugs, and automatically fixes your
  save if you remove some custom-content mods.

* **Improved mod scanning.**  
  SMAPI now supports some non-standard mod structures automatically, improves compatibility with
  the Vortex mod manager, and improves various error/skip messages related to mod loading.

* **Overhauled update checks.**  
  SMAPI update checks are now handled entirely on the web server and support community-defined
  version mappings. In particular, false update alerts due to author mistakes can now be solved by
  the community for all players.

* **Fixed many bugs and edge cases.**

For mod authors:
* **New event system.**  
  SMAPI 3.0 removes the deprecated static events in favor of the new `helper.Events` API. The event
  engine is rewritten to make events more efficient, add events that weren't possible before, make
  existing events more useful, and make event usage and behavior more consistent. When a mod makes
  changes in an event handler, those changes are now also reflected in the next event raise.

* **Improved mod build package.**  
  The [mod build package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig) now
  includes the `assets` folder by default if present, supports the new `.csproj` project format,
  enables mod `.pdb` files automatically (to provide line numbers in error messages), adds optional
  Harmony support, and fixes some bugs and edge cases. This also adds compatibility with SMAPI 3.0
  and Stardew Valley 1.4, and drops support for older versions.

* **Mods loaded earlier.**  
  SMAPI now loads mods much earlier, before the game is initialised. That lets mods do things that
  were difficult before, like intercepting some core assets.

* **Improved Android support.**  
  SMAPI now automatically detects when it's running on Android, and updates `Constants.TargetPlatform`
  so mods can adjust their logic if needed. The Save Backup mod is also now Android-compatible.

* **Improved asset propagation.**  
  SMAPI now automatically propagates asset changes for farm animal data, NPC default location data,
  critter textures, and `DayTimeMoneyBox` buttons. Every loaded texture now also has a `Name` field
  so mods can check which asset a texture was loaded for.

* **Breaking changes:**  
  See _[migrate to SMAPI 3.0](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_SMAPI_3.0)_ and
  _[migrate to Stardew Valley 1.4](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_Stardew_Valley_1.4)_
  for more info.

### For players
* Changes:
  * Updated for Stardew Valley 1.4.
  * Improved performance.
  * Reworked update checks and added community-defined version mapping, to reduce false update alerts due to author mistakes.
  * SMAPI now removes invalid locations/NPCs when loading a save to prevent crashes. A warning is shown in-game when this happens.
  * Added update checks for CurseForge mods.
  * Added support for editing console colors via `smapi-internal/config.json` (for players with unusual consoles).
  * Added support for setting SMAPI CLI arguments as environment variables for Linux/macOS compatibility.
  * Improved mod scanning:
    * Now ignores metadata files/folders (like `__MACOSX` and `__folder_managed_by_vortex`) and content files (like `.txt` or `.png`), which avoids missing-manifest errors in some cases.
    * Now detects XNB mods more accurately, and consolidates multi-folder XNB mods in logged messages.
  * Improved launch script compatibility on Linux (thanks to kurumushi and toastal!).
  * Made error messages more user-friendly in some cases.
  * Save Backup now works in the background, to avoid affecting startup time for players with a large number of saves.
  * The installer now recognises custom game paths stored in [`stardewvalley.targets`](http://smapi.io/package/custom-game-path).
  * Duplicate-mod errors now show the mod version in each folder.
  * Update checks are now faster in some cases.
  * Updated mod compatibility list.
  * Updated SMAPI/game version map.
  * Updated translations. Thanks to eren-kemer (added German)!
* Fixes:
  * Fixed some assets not updated when you switch language to English.
  * Fixed lag in some cases due to incorrect asset caching when playing in non-English.
  * Fixed lag when a mod invalidates many NPC portraits/sprites at once.
  * Fixed Console Commands not including upgraded tools in item commands.
  * Fixed Console Commands' item commands failing if a mod adds invalid item data.
  * Fixed Save Backup not pruning old backups if they're uncompressed.
  * Fixed issues when a farmhand reconnects before the game notices they're disconnected.
  * Fixed 'received message' logs shown in non-developer mode.
  * Fixed various error messages and inconsistent spelling.
  * Fixed update-check error if a Nexus mod is marked as adult content.
  * Fixed update-check error if the Chucklefish page for an update key doesn't exist.

### For the web UI
* Mod compatibility list:
  * Added support for CurseForge mods.
  * Added metadata links and dev notes (if any) to advanced info.
  * Now loads faster (since data is fetched in a background service).
  * Now continues working with cached data when the wiki is offline.
  * Clicking a mod link now automatically adds it to the visible mods if the list is filtered.

* JSON validator:
  * Added JSON validator at [smapi.io/json](https://smapi.io/json), which lets you validate a JSON file against predefined mod formats.
  * Added support for the `manifest.json` format.
  * Added support for the Content Patcher format (thanks to TehPers!).
  * Added support for referencing a schema in a JSON Schema-compatible text editor.

* For the log parser:
  * Added instructions for Android.
  * The page now detects your OS and preselects the right instructions (thanks to danvolchek!).

### For mod authors
* Breaking changes:
  * Mods are now loaded much earlier in the game launch. This lets mods intercept any content asset, but the game is not fully initialized when `Entry` is called; use the `GameLaunched` event if you need to run code when the game is initialized.
  * Removed all deprecated APIs.
  * Removed unused APIs: `Monitor.ExitGameImmediately`, `Translation.ModName`, and `Translation.Assert`.
  * Fixed `ICursorPosition.AbsolutePixels` not adjusted for zoom.
  * `SemanticVersion` no longer omits `.0` patch numbers when formatting versions, for better [semver](https://semver.org/) conformity (e.g. `3.0` is now formatted as `3.0.0`).
* Changes:
  * Added support for content pack translations.
  * Added `IContentPack.HasFile`, `Context.IsGameLaunched`, and `SemanticVersion.TryParse`.
  * Added separate `LogNetworkTraffic` option to make verbose logging less overwhelmingly verbose.
  * Added asset propagation for `Data\FarmAnimals`, critter textures, and `DayTimeMoneyBox` buttons.
  * Added `Texture2D.Name` values set to the asset key.
  * Added trace logs for skipped loose files in the `Mods` folder and custom SMAPI settings so it's easier to troubleshoot player logs.
  * `Constants.TargetPlatform` now returns `Android` when playing on an Android device.
  * Trace logs for a broken mod now list all detected issues (instead of the first one).
  * Trace logs when loading mods are now more clear.
  * Clarified update-check errors for mods with multiple update keys.
  * Updated dependencies (including Json.NET 11.0.2 → 12.0.3 and Mono.Cecil 0.10.1 → 0.11.1).
* Fixes:
  * Fixed map reloads resetting tilesheet seasons.
  * Fixed map reloads not updating door warps.
  * Fixed outdoor tilesheets being seasonalised when added to an indoor location.
  * Fixed mods needing to load custom `Map` assets before the game accesses them. SMAPI now does so automatically.
  * Fixed custom maps loaded from `.xnb` files not having their tilesheet paths automatically adjusted.
  * Fixed custom maps loaded from the mod folder with tilesheets in a subfolder not working crossplatform. All tilesheet paths are now normalized for the OS automatically.
  * Fixed issue where mod changes weren't tracked correctly for raising events in some cases. Events now reflect a frozen snapshot of the game state, and any mod changes are reflected in the next event tick.
  * Fixed issue where, when a mod's `IAssetEditor` uses `asset.ReplaceWith` on a texture asset while playing in non-English, any changes from that point forth wouldn't affect subsequent cached asset loads.
  * Fixed asset propagation for NPC portraits resetting any unique portraits (e.g. Maru's hospital portrait) to the default.
  * Fixed changes to `Data\NPCDispositions` not always propagated correctly to existing NPCs.
  * Fixed `Rendering`/`Rendered` events not raised during minigames.
  * Fixed `LoadStageChanged` event not raising correct flags in some cases when creating a new save.
  * Fixed `GetApi` without an interface not checking if all mods are loaded.

### For SMAPI maintainers
* Added support for core translation files.
* Migrated to new `.csproj` format.
* Internal refactoring.
