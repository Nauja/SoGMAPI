SoGMAPI lets you run Secrets of Grindea with mods. Don't forget to download mods separately.


Player's guide
--------------------------------
For now you can see https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide for help installing
SoGMAPI, adding mods, etc as this is based on SMAPI.


Manual install
--------------------------------
THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MOST PLAYERS. See instructions above instead.
If you really want to install SoGMAPI manually, here's how.

1. Unzip "internal/windows-install.dat". You can change '.dat' to '.zip',
   it's just a normal zip file renamed to prevent confusion.
2. Copy the files from the folder you just unzipped into your game folder. The
   `SoGModdingAPI.exe` file should be right next to the game's executable.
3.
  - If you use Steam, see the install guide above to enable achievements and
    overlay. Otherwise, just run SoGModdingAPI.exe in your game folder to play with mods.
