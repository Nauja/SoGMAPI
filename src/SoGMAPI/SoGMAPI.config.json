/*



This file contains advanced configuration for SMAPI. You generally shouldn't change this file.
The default values are mirrored in StardewModdingAPI.Framework.Models.SConfig to log custom changes.


This file is overwritten each time you update or reinstall SMAPI. To avoid losing custom settings,
create a 'config.user.json' file in the same folder with *only* the settings you want to change.
That file won't be overwritten, and any settings in it will override the default options. Don't
copy all the settings, or you may cause bugs due to overridden changes in future SMAPI versions.
